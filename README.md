Dear VAPT Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

Moving forward, we will be implementing a new standardized process for handling all VAPT requests. Before accepting any request from project teams, please ensure that the following steps are strictly followed:
	1.	Request Submission via Insight Portal:
	•	All project teams must raise a ticket in the Insight Portal.
	•	The ticket should be logged under the tracker named IVAPT.
	2.	Ticket Assignment:
	•	Once the ticket is raised, it should be assigned to the VAPT team for further processing.
	3.	Maintain a Single Email Chain:
	•	Ensure that all communication related to the request is maintained within a single email chain.
	•	This will help us track the request easily and serve as a reference for any changes or implementation updates.
	•	Additionally, it will act as evidence for future audits or reviews.

This process will help us streamline and track all VAPT requests efficiently, ensuring proper documentation and accountability. Kindly adhere to this standalone process starting immediately.
